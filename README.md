##Makers Academy Weekend Challenge - Week 2 Pt2

to run from irb
```shell
require './lib/order_interface'
require './lib/order_manager'
require './lib/menu_manager'
require './lib/text_confirmation'

order_interface = OrderInterface.new
order_interface.interactive menu
```


###Coding Objective: Write a Takeaway program.
###Learning Objective: Ruby, Object Oriented Design, Test Driven Development, Twilio API integration through gem

Implement the following functionality:
- list of dishes with prices
- placing the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. 
  - If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
- The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  - Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  - Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.

Note: We are looking for good OO design and programming! Remember the SOLID principles!

##Class Responsibility Collaborators - Domain Model

###OrderInterface
| Responsibility | Collaborators|
|----------------|--------------|
| customer interaction | OrderManager | 

###OrderManager
| Responsibility | Collaborators|
|----------------|--------------|
| display Menu   | MenuManager  |
| take Order     | |
| validate Order | |
| text Customer | TextConfirmation |

###MenuManager
| Responsibility | Collaborators|
|----------------|--------------|
| load Menu      | OrderManager |
| display Menu   | OrderManager |

###TextConfirmation
| Responsibility | Collaborators|
|----------------|--------------|
| text Customer  | OrderManager | 

###Domain Model Thoughts
My initial thoughts were for a more complex model. My questions around the domain model come from separation questions of objects vs processes. In Battleships it was quite clear what the major objects were, however in this case it was less clear and I had confused processes (e.g. confirm order) with objects (e.g. menu).

Have now fixed the below comment =>
  However in the model I have implemented I feel that the interface management needs to be separated out from the management of the order (eg. to have OrderInterface and OrderManagement classes).
